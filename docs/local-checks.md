# Local checks and GitHub builds

GitHub Actions is for producing deliverables: release packages, tools, installers
and other usable build artifacts. Regression tests run locally. Do not add
standalone CI workflows or upload test reports merely to make them count as
artifact-producing workflows. The host release workflow builds, packages and
publishes the Windows host release; validate relevant changes before publishing.

The former panel, T3 provisioning, native ISO integration and host-release test
commands are preserved in local runners. They do not restart live T3 services.

On Linux, install Node.js, Python 3, jq, PowerShell (`pwsh`) and the .NET 10 SDK.
The gateway tests require aiohttp for `/usr/bin/python3` (on Ubuntu:
`apt-get install python3-aiohttp jq`). Set up browser-test dependencies once:

```sh
cd extension/test
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Then, from the repository root, choose the checks relevant to the change:

```sh
bash test/run-local-checks.sh panel
bash test/run-local-checks.sh t3
bash test/run-local-checks.sh service
# Or run all three groups:
bash test/run-local-checks.sh all
```

The panel defaults to the native theme; set `UI_SMOKE_THEME=classic` or `terminal`
to check another theme. These runners group the former workflow checks; other
focused tests remain available in `test/`, `extension/test/` and `service/tests/`.

Windows PowerShell 5.1 behavior and the pinned Windows ISO executable need an
actual Windows environment. Use a local disposable Windows VM with Node.js,
Windows PowerShell 5.1 and network access for downloading the pinned executable:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test/run-local-windows-checks.ps1
```

GitHub runners provide convenience and clean environments, not unique test
capabilities. A local Windows VM covers the platform-specific checks that this
Linux development VM cannot execute directly.
